Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/6] ls-tree: introduce '--pattern' option

This RFC patch introduce a new "ls-tree" option "--pattern", aim to match the
entries by regex then filter the output which we may want to achieve. It also
contains some commit for preparation or cleanup.

The idea may be not comprehensive and the tests for it might be insufficient
too, but I'd like to listen the suggestion from the community to decide if it's
worth going forward with.

Thanks.
