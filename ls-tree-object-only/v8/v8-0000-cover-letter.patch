Subject: [PATCH v8 0/1] support `--object-only` option for "git-ls-tree"

Diff from patch v6:

     * Patch v8 only fix the tests bugs that found by
       Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason at [1].

I noticed yesterday that Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason sent a RFC patch v7 about
support a "--format" option for this.

I will send a v9 patch (RFC marked also?) which may contains some
Ævar's commits as a WAY-2 solution, WAY-1 is the current patch v8.
It's also replied to 'What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2021, #05; Thu, 23)'
at [2].
