Subject: [PATCH v1 0/1] surround %s with quotes when failed to lookup commit

When lookup commit fails, wrap quotes around %s format specifier.

Do we have to put a "<topic>": or "<filename>:" before the commit
title, such as this patch, which modifies two different features,
how should we name it appropriately.

Thanks.
