Yes, I noticed it too, but I'm not sure whether there exists the same
requirement in `git commit -m <message> -F <file> ...`, `git commit` is
usually a more frequently used subcommand, firstly introduced it to
`git notes` maybe is a good idea, but I'm not going to touch `git commit`
yet, unless we find someone who has a strong need.

Thanks.
