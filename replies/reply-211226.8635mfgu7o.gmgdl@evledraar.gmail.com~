Yes there's the test problem I mentioned in [1], but in addition to that
your current set of patches have around a ~10% performance regression,
as noted in [2]. My RFC series[2] side-steps that by leaving the current
code in-place, and only introducing a new optional --format path for new
output formats.

I really don't mind if you go for "WAY-1" first over my RFC --format
"WAY-2", but I do think any such change should be prominently
noting/selling that this new feature is worth the performance
regression, or finding some alternate "WAY-1+" to avoid it.
