git notes subcommand can save binary file in note message.
We can find some clues in git-notes.txt and t3304-notes-man.sh.
By default, the file specified by `-F` will do stripspace for
the whole file content, for example, if the binary file contains
consecutive newlines it will be compressed into only one, in
another word, the binary file which recover from this like note
message will become corrupt, so I made patch[1] to support an option
`--[no-]stripspace` will solve this.

I'm not sure the scenario of using git note to save the binary is
suitable, but the above context may give some ideas, maybe.

Thanks.
