I have been on vacation for the last two weeks, sorry for not
replying in time.

I think that is :

  time-1: v9 was in next, actually v9 [4/6] will break the CI, but
          [5/6] fix it so the CI passed on the whole patchset.
  time-2: then v10 was tought a new `--no-separator ` mainly
          On the release point, v10 implicitly fixed the problem
          in v9 [4/6]
  time-3: 2.41 release work begin
  time-4: Peff found that the v9 [4/6] merged in next would break
          CI and a UBSan problem.
  time-5: I wanted to make a full reroll to fix the UBSan problem,
          by the way, separate the "--no-separator" to a single
          commit, because I thought it cannot catch the last bus
          on 2.41 maybe.

I think we are now in a new cycle, maybe we could rewind and use
v11 directlly? Sorry that it may have brought on extra work.

Thanks.
