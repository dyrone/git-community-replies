I'm glad there are use cases for the topic.

There is indeed this change in the process, I did not express it clearly in the
patch, sorry,  allow me to explain it:

Initially, I wanted to support separator insertion with --[no-]blankline. It was
intuitive and clear in logic. If it is specified as --blankline, newline would
be append, if it is --no-blankline, newline would not be append, and --blankline
would be the default behavior.

The problem with this is that "blankline" might not be a good name because it
doesn't seem to express the meaning of the separator or paragraph-break, and
since we're going to support separators, it might be more thorough to support a
custom separator, which is a better solution I think.

Returning to the issue of -separator = "", my thought is that I want
--separator="" to behave the same way as
--separator="<any-string-without-a-trailing-\n'>" when deals a string which does
not contains a trailing newline. This will eliminate one more implicit logic and
make behavior more consistent.

I think --no-separator maybe a better name, means that not any separator will be
append between two paragraphs even a newline.

Thanks.
