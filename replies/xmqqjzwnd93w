OK, I hope to make the commit more cohesive before they release, but
I ignored that the 'next' branch is already in the release period
(because I think it might be possible to replace it in the 'next', but
actually it shouldn't be done), sorry for the trouble it may cause you.

OK.

I think the v11 should be a version which is acceptable if there is
no incoming review conversitions (The current v11 that separates
'--no-separator' as a individual commit OR make 7/7 into 4/7, both
approaches seem fine)?

Thanks.
