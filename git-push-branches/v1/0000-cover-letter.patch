Subject: [PATCH 0/1] push: introduce '--branches' option

Based on the feedback I got from the previous RFC
patch, I made a formal patch with some additional
test cases, but I don't know if the scenarios covered by
the test cases are sufficient, if not, the cases will be
improved in a subsequent patch.

Thanks.
